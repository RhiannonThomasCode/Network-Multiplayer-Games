		/* WARNING: DO NOT OVER USE TCP CONNECTIONS BY OPENING
		AND CLOSING THE SOCKETS TOO QUICKLY.
		Use UDP instead if you want to send large amounts of sporadic
		data.
		If you want to send a lot of data using TCP, keep the connection
		open and use multiple sends. This is also more efficient because
		the overhead of the connection process is quite significant.
		However, you should need keep the socket open for long periods
		so this is not always possible.
		Instead, use socket pooling to avoid closing the sockets.

		Alternatively, you could modify "MaxUserPort" and
		"TcpTimedWaitDelay".
		Increase the default MaxUserPort setting and reduce the
		TcpTimedWaitDelay setting so that you do not run out of
		client anonymous ports. For example, you can set the
		MaxUserPort setting to 20000 and set the TcpTimedWaitDelay
		setting to 30. A lower TcpTimedWaitDelay setting means that
		the sockets wait in the TIME_WAIT state for less time.
		A higher MaxUserPort setting means that you can have more
		sockets in the TIME_WAIT state.
		Note that if you adjust the MaxUserPort or TcpTimedWaitDelay
		setting, you must restart Microsoft Windows for the new setting
		to take effect.

		Explanation of Problem:
		=======================
		The Winsock control will get an error after a Connect method
		is called if the same local port has been used within the
		past four minutes.
		The Windows socket control does not have the ability to set the
		socket option SO_REUSEADDR. This option allows the socket to be
		bound to an address that is already in use.
		When you close the handle to a socket, some additional
		negotiation goes on between the client and the server. The socket
		will wait for up to two times the maximum time that windows would
		wait to receive an acknowledgement from the other end of the
		socket that closed the port. By default, this option is set
		to two minutes. Therefore, Windows may wait up to four minutes
		before the port is actually released.
		This makes that specific port unavailable until it is actually
		released.
		If you are not using socket pooling, and/or your request model
		is something like one request = one outbound TCP connection
		(or more!).
		In this type of scenario, you can run out of ephemeral ports
		(between 1024 and MaxUserPort) very quickly, and the problem
		will scale with the load applied to the system, particularly
		if a socket is acquired and abandoned with every request.
